## User Guide
Coming soon.  There's still some work to do to add a built-in help system, and to add a few roadmap features which will need documenting.

## Extending - Create New Renderers
Coming soon.  ~There's still some work to do to make the renderers inject their own markup, which will decouple the HTML from the standalone rendering component.  Once this is done, then a guide to building bolt-on renderers will be added.~ Renderers now inject their own markup!..  Guide on its way!
